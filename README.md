## Markowitz Model
- Markowitz Model is an optimization problem that leads to minimum varinace problem.
- To find minimum varinace portfolio,we fix some mean value at some arbitary value rÌ„ (which we enter as a portfolio return we want).
- Then we find feasible portfolio with minimum variance that has this mean.
